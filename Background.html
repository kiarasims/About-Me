        <p> My full name is <span style="color:blue">Kiara Delphine Sims</span>. My middle name Delphine comes from my great grandmother.<br> 
            I was born and raised in New Orleans Louisiana until I was 5 years old. We moved to Mississippi<br>
            during Hurrican Katrina. I lived in a little town until after my 7th grade year. My 8th grade year<br>
            I moved to St. Francisville, Louisiana. However, I only stayed there until February of my 8th grade<br>
            due to personal reasons. Since February of my 8th grade year I have been back in New Orleans. Now I<br>
            am still there and attend Xavier University of Louisiana for Computer Science.
